# ethan_rust README

### explain ethan
Ethan is basically sad dreidel. There's a pot (aptly named Ethan) and some n number of players that each start with m number of chips. Each player takes turns rolling 2 dice but only if they are in possession of any chips (i.e. if a player has no chips, they lose and can no longer play). If the player rolls a 4, they get all of Ethan's chips. If the Ethan Eyes rule is on and the player rolls a 2, they lose all of their chips. For all other rolls, the player loses a single chip to Ethan. 

The game ends either Ethan has all of the chips (i.e. everybody loses) or if a single player is holding all of the chips (that player wins).
